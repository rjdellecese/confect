## 9.0.0-next.3

### Patch Changes

- 6d85210: Resolve `FunctionImpl` / `GroupImpl` group paths via an immutable `paths` map on `Spec` instead of identity-walking the assembled tree.

  ### Why

  Since `9.0.0-next.1`, codegen has wrapped every parent leaf that has sibling subdirectory specs in `<parent>.addGroupAt("child", <child>)`. Because `GroupSpec.addGroupAt` is immutable, that produced a fresh object in the assembled tree, while the parent's `*.impl.ts` continued to hold a reference to the original imported leaf. The runtime resolver compared by `===`, so every such impl failed `validateImpl` with "Could not resolve group path for the provided GroupSpec." Child impls happened to work only because `GroupSpec.withName` was secretly mutating its argument in place to keep the child's identity stable — an asymmetry that was load-bearing for one half of the API and broken for the other.

  ### What changed
  - `@confect/core/Spec` carries a new `readonly paths: ReadonlyMap<GroupSpec.AnyWithProps, string>` field and exposes a chainable `Spec#addPath(group, path)` builder. `add` / `addAt` / `merge` propagate `paths` unchanged; `merge` re-prefixes a node spec's entries with `"node."` to match the merged tree.
  - `@confect/core/GroupSpec.withName` is now pure: it returns a fresh copy when the name differs and no longer rewrites the input in place. No new identity-tracking machinery is introduced.
  - `@confect/server/FunctionImpl.make` and `GroupImpl.make` resolve their group path via `api.spec.paths.get(group)` — an O(1) map lookup instead of a tree walk — and throw a clearer error pointing at `Spec.addPath` when the spec hasn't been registered.
  - `@confect/server/GroupPath` (the old identity-based resolver) is deleted.
  - `@confect/cli` codegen emits one `.addPath(<binding>, "<dot.path>")` call per leaf in `_generated/spec.ts` (and `_generated/nodeSpec.ts`) so the imported leaves carry their full paths into the assembled spec value.

  ### User-facing impact
  - Spec authoring (`*.spec.ts`) and impl authoring (`*.impl.ts`) APIs are unchanged. `FunctionImpl.make(api, spec, name, handler)` and `GroupImpl.make(api, spec)` keep their exact signatures.
  - Generated `_generated/spec.ts` (and `_generated/nodeSpec.ts`) pick up one `.addPath(...)` chain entry per leaf on the next `confect codegen` run. The shape is fully immutable — no module-load mutation, no hidden side effects.
  - Hand-rolled tests that construct a `Spec` and pass it to `Api.make` must now also call `.addPath(spec, "dot.path")` for any group they intend to look up.

  ### Fixes

  This eliminates the runtime regression introduced in `9.0.0-next.1` for any project layout where a `confect/{path}.spec.ts` declares functions alongside a sibling `confect/{path}/` subdirectory of further specs.

### Major Changes

- 6db3a3a: Derive Confect function paths from the filesystem layout of `confect/`. Each group lives in a colocated `*.spec.ts`/`*.impl.ts` pair, and the group's name is its path within `confect/` (file stem for top-level groups, dot-joined directory path for nested groups). See [Project Structure](https://confect.dev/concepts/project-structure), [File Naming Conventions](https://confect.dev/concepts/file-naming-conventions), and [The Spec/Impl Model](https://confect.dev/concepts/spec-impl-model) for the current model.

  Each `*.spec.ts` default-exports its `GroupSpec`. Each `*.impl.ts` default-imports its sibling spec, builds its `GroupImpl`, and default-exports the result of `GroupImpl.finalize`. Named co-exports on `*.spec.ts` (such as error classes) remain allowed.

  ### Why

  The previous model assembled every group's impl into a single root `confect/impl.ts` (plus `confect/nodeImpl.ts`), which `confect codegen` emitted as the aggregate `_generated/registeredFunctions.ts`. Every generated `convex/` module — one per Convex function — imported from that aggregate, so loading any single query, mutation, or action transitively loaded the impl module of every other Convex function in the project, along with all of their dependencies. For large projects this inflated each function's bundle and added meaningful cold-start cost on Convex.

  Splitting impl across colocated `*.impl.ts` files is the vehicle for fixing that. With this change, `confect codegen` emits one `_generated/registeredFunctions/{path}.ts` per group, and each generated `convex/` module imports only its own group's per-group registry — which in turn imports only its own sibling `.impl.ts`. A Convex function's cold-start bundle now scales with its own group's impl rather than with the size of the whole project.

  ### Breaking changes
  - `GroupSpec.make()` and `GroupSpec.makeNode()` no longer take a name argument; the group name is derived from the spec file's path within `confect/`.
  - `FunctionImpl.make(api, groupSpec, fn, handler)` and `GroupImpl.make(api, groupSpec)` now take the imported sibling spec object as their second argument instead of a dot-path string.
  - Every `GroupImpl` pipeline must end with `GroupImpl.finalize`, which only typechecks once every function declared by the spec has a corresponding `FunctionImpl` provided to the group layer. `GroupImpl.finalize` snapshots the names of every registered function onto the produced `Finalized` `GroupImpl` service value, and `confect codegen` reads those names to verify per-function coverage against the spec at runtime.
  - The previously-exported `Impl.make` and `Impl.finalize` (used by the old root `impl.ts`/`nodeImpl.ts` files) are removed. Per-group completeness is now enforced by `GroupImpl.finalize`.
  - Root `confect/spec.ts`, `confect/impl.ts`, `confect/nodeSpec.ts`, `confect/nodeImpl.ts`, and any parent aggregator `*.spec.ts`/`*.impl.ts` files are no longer used. `confect codegen` deletes any of these on upgrade, along with the stale `_generated/registeredFunctions.ts` and `_generated/nodeRegisteredFunctions.ts`.
  - Every module under `convex/` is re-emitted to import from `_generated/registeredFunctions/{path}` instead of the previous aggregate file. Users who commit `convex/` to source control should expect a full rewrite of that directory on first codegen.

  ### Migration
  1. For each existing group, create a colocated `confect/{path}.spec.ts` and `confect/{path}.impl.ts` pair (under a subdirectory for nested groups).
     - In each spec, call `GroupSpec.make()` (or `GroupSpec.makeNode()`) without a name and `export default` the result.
     - In each impl, default-import the sibling spec (e.g. `import notes from "./notes.spec"`), pass it to `FunctionImpl.make`/`GroupImpl.make` in place of the previous dot-path string, append `GroupImpl.finalize` to the pipeline, and `export default` the resulting `GroupImpl` layer:
       ```ts
       export default GroupImpl.make(api, notes).pipe(
         Layer.provide(list),
         Layer.provide(insert),
         GroupImpl.finalize,
       );
       ```
  2. Delete root `confect/spec.ts`, `confect/impl.ts`, `confect/nodeSpec.ts`, `confect/nodeImpl.ts`, and any parent aggregator spec/impl files. (`confect codegen` will also delete any of these it finds, plus the stale `_generated/registeredFunctions.ts` and `_generated/nodeRegisteredFunctions.ts`, so this step can be skipped.)
  3. Run `confect codegen`. Every module under `convex/` will be re-emitted.

## 8.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 4bb2722: Bump Effect ecosystem to latest. `@effect/platform` is now `^0.96.1` and `@effect/platform-node` is now `^0.106.0` in `@confect/server`'s peer dependencies; `effect` peer is now `^3.21.2` across packages. Consumers must upgrade `@effect/platform`, `@effect/platform-node`, and `effect` in lockstep when bumping `@confect/server`.

### Patch Changes

- 40c1cff: Switch sibling `@confect/*` peer-dependency specifiers from `workspace:*` to `workspace:^`. Published peer ranges are now caret-based (e.g. `^7.0.0`) instead of exact-pinned, so non-major upgrades of one `@confect/*` package no longer fall out of range for its peer dependents.

  Paired with the Changesets `onlyUpdatePeerDependentsWhenOutOfRange` flag, this prevents the entire `@confect/*` family from being promoted to a major bump on every release when only minor/patch changes are present.

  `@confect/cli` additionally moves `@effect/platform` from `peerDependencies` to `dependencies`, since the CLI consumes it as an internal implementation detail (for `FileSystem`/`Path`) rather than exposing it in its public API. Consumers no longer need to install `@effect/platform` themselves to use the CLI.

## 7.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 90094d0: Add typed errors to Confect functions (queries, mutations, and actions). Declare an optional `error` schema in `FunctionSpec` and recover it as a typed value at every call site—`useQuery`, `useMutation`, `useAction`, `HttpClient`, `WebSocketClient`, and `TestConfect`—without paying for it on functions that don't fail.

  Typed errors travel across the function boundary as Convex's native [`ConvexError`](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/error-handling/application-errors#throwing-application-errors): the encoded error sits in `ConvexError.data`, leaving the `returns` channel unsullied and preserving native Convex semantics for non-Confect callers of the same API.

  ### Authoring a function with typed errors

  `FunctionSpec` constructors now accept an optional `error` schema. To support multiple error shapes, combine them with `Schema.Union`.

  ```ts
  import { FunctionSpec, GenericId, GroupSpec } from "@confect/core";
  import { Schema } from "effect";

  export class NoteNotFound extends Schema.TaggedError<NoteNotFound>()(
    "NoteNotFound",
    { noteId: GenericId.GenericId("notes") },
  ) {}

  export const notes = GroupSpec.make("notes").addFunction(
    FunctionSpec.publicQuery({
      name: "getOrFail",
      args: Schema.Struct({ noteId: GenericId.GenericId("notes") }),
      returns: Notes.Doc,
      error: NoteNotFound,
    }),
  );
  ```

  The `FunctionImpl` for that ref can now `Effect.fail` (or `mapError` to) any value matching the declared schema. Whichever invocation path the caller takes—`useQuery`/`useMutation`/`useAction`, `HttpClient`, `WebSocketClient`, or `TestConfect`—Confect encodes the failure, transports it via `ConvexError`, and surfaces the decoded value in the appropriate channel for that call site.

  ```ts
  import { FunctionImpl } from "@confect/server";
  import { Effect } from "effect";
  import api from "../_generated/api";
  import { DatabaseReader } from "../_generated/services";
  import { NoteNotFound } from "./notes.spec";

  const getOrFail = FunctionImpl.make(api, "notes", "getOrFail", ({ noteId }) =>
    Effect.gen(function* () {
      const reader = yield* DatabaseReader;
      return yield* reader
        .table("notes")
        .get(noteId)
        .pipe(Effect.mapError(() => new NoteNotFound({ noteId })));
    }),
  );
  ```

  ### Consuming a typed error

  `@confect/js` (`HttpClient`, `WebSocketClient`) and `@confect/test` (`TestConfect`) surface the decoded error in the `Effect` error channel alongside the existing `HttpClientError`/`WebSocketClientError`/`ParseError`:

  ```ts
  HttpClient.query(refs.public.notes.getOrFail, { noteId });
  // Effect.Effect<Note, NoteNotFound | HttpClientError | ParseError>
  ```

  ### `@confect/react`—breaking changes

  `useQuery`, `useMutation`, and `useAction` now expose typed errors, and `useQuery` returns a tagged result type instead of `Returns | undefined`.

  **`useQuery` now returns `QueryResult<A, E>`.** Loading and (when an `error` schema is declared) failure are reified as variants alongside success. Match on the result with `QueryResult.match`:

  Before:

  ```tsx
  const notes = useQuery(refs.public.notes.list, {});
  if (notes === undefined) return <p>Loading…</p>;
  return <NoteList notes={notes} />;
  ```

  After:

  ```tsx
  import { QueryResult, useQuery } from "@confect/react";

  const notes = useQuery(refs.public.notes.list, {});
  return QueryResult.match(notes, {
    onLoading: (skipped) => (skipped ? null : <p>Loading…</p>),
    onSuccess: (notes) => <NoteList notes={notes} />,
  });
  ```

  The `Loading` variant carries a `skipped: boolean` flag, exposed as the argument to `onLoading`. It distinguishes a query that is genuinely in flight (`skipped: false`) from one that is sitting idle because `"skip"` was passed as its args (`skipped: true`)—a distinction `convex/react`'s plain `undefined` return value cannot make. Use it to render a loading indicator only when work is actually happening, and an empty/placeholder state otherwise.

  When the ref declares an `error` schema, `onFailure` becomes required and receives the decoded typed error:

  ```tsx
  const lookup = useQuery(refs.public.notes.getOrFail, { noteId });
  QueryResult.match(lookup, {
    onLoading: (skipped) => (skipped ? null : "Looking up…"),
    onSuccess: (note) => `Found: ${note.text}`,
    onFailure: (error) => `Note ${error.noteId} not found.`,
  });
  ```

  `QueryResult` is a Confect-native type exported from `@confect/react`.

  **`useMutation` and `useAction` return `Promise<Either<A, E>>` when the ref declares an `error` schema.** Refs without an `error` schema continue to resolve to `Promise<A>`, matching the prior shape and `convex/react`'s behavior.

  ```ts
  const deleteOrFail = useMutation(refs.public.notes.deleteOrFail);
  const result = await deleteOrFail({ noteId });
  // Either.Either<null, NoteNotFound | Forbidden>
  Either.match(result, {
    onLeft: (error) => /* typed error */,
    onRight: (value) => /* success */,
  });

  const deleteNote = useMutation(refs.public.notes.delete_); // no `error` schema
  await deleteNote({ noteId }); // Promise<null>, as before
  ```

  Unspecified failures continue to reject the promise.

  ### Migration
  - For each `useQuery` call site, replace `result === undefined` checks and direct property access with `QueryResult.match` (or the lower-level `QueryResult.isLoading`/`isSuccess`/`isFailure` predicates).
  - For each `useMutation`/`useAction` call site whose ref now declares an `error` schema, unwrap the resolved `Either` (e.g. with `Either.match`); call sites against refs without an `error` schema need no change.
