# Confect 🧁

Confect is a framework that deeply integrates Effect with Convex. It's more than just Effect bindings! Confect allows you to:

- Define your Convex database schema using Effect schemas.
- Write Convex function args and returns validators using Effect's schema library.
- Use Confect functions to automatically decode and encode your data according to your Effect schema definitions for end-to-end rich types, from client to function to database (and back).
- Use Effect's HTTP API modules to define your HTTP API(s). Includes interactive OpenAPI documentation powered by [Scalar](https://github.com/scalar/scalar).
- Access Convex platform capabilities via Effect services.
