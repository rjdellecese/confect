## Overview

Explain expected default exports.

- `schema.ts`: The database schema.
- `api.ts`: The Confect functions API.
- `crons.ts`: The cron jobs.
- `http.ts`: The HTTP API.
- `app.ts`: Maps to `convex.config.ts`
- `auth.ts`: Maps to `auth.config.ts`

Confect treats the `convex` directory as a codegen target. While using Confect, you should never modify files in the `convex` folder directly.

Under most circumstances, you don't even need to run the Convex CLI's `codegen` command.
