Resolve `FunctionImpl` / `GroupImpl` group paths via an immutable `paths` map on `Spec` instead of identity-walking the assembled tree.

### Why

Since `9.0.0-next.1`, codegen has wrapped every parent leaf that has sibling subdirectory specs in `<parent>.addGroupAt("child", <child>)`. Because `GroupSpec.addGroupAt` is immutable, that produced a fresh object in the assembled tree, while the parent's `*.impl.ts` continued to hold a reference to the original imported leaf. The runtime resolver compared by `===`, so every such impl failed `validateImpl` with "Could not resolve group path for the provided GroupSpec." Child impls happened to work only because `GroupSpec.withName` was secretly mutating its argument in place to keep the child's identity stable — an asymmetry that was load-bearing for one half of the API and broken for the other.

### What changed

- `@confect/core/Spec` carries a new `readonly paths: ReadonlyMap<GroupSpec.AnyWithProps, string>` field and exposes a chainable `Spec#addPath(group, path)` builder. `add` / `addAt` / `merge` propagate `paths` unchanged; `merge` re-prefixes a node spec's entries with `"node."` to match the merged tree.
- `@confect/core/GroupSpec.withName` is now pure: it returns a fresh copy when the name differs and no longer rewrites the input in place. No new identity-tracking machinery is introduced.
- `@confect/server/FunctionImpl.make` and `GroupImpl.make` resolve their group path via `api.spec.paths.get(group)` — an O(1) map lookup instead of a tree walk — and throw a clearer error pointing at `Spec.addPath` when the spec hasn't been registered.
- `@confect/server/GroupPath` (the old identity-based resolver) is deleted.
- `@confect/cli` codegen emits one `.addPath(<binding>, "<dot.path>")` call per leaf in `_generated/spec.ts` (and `_generated/nodeSpec.ts`) so the imported leaves carry their full paths into the assembled spec value.

### User-facing impact

- Spec authoring (`*.spec.ts`) and impl authoring (`*.impl.ts`) APIs are unchanged. `FunctionImpl.make(api, spec, name, handler)` and `GroupImpl.make(api, spec)` keep their exact signatures.
- Generated `_generated/spec.ts` (and `_generated/nodeSpec.ts`) pick up one `.addPath(...)` chain entry per leaf on the next `confect codegen` run. The shape is fully immutable — no module-load mutation, no hidden side effects.
- Hand-rolled tests that construct a `Spec` and pass it to `Api.make` must now also call `.addPath(spec, "dot.path")` for any group they intend to look up.

### Fixes

This eliminates the runtime regression introduced in `9.0.0-next.1` for any project layout where a `confect/{path}.spec.ts` declares functions alongside a sibling `confect/{path}/` subdirectory of further specs.
