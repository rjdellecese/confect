<Warning>Confect is pre-1.0 and its API is not yet stable.</Warning>

Confect is a framework that deeply integrates Effect with Convex. It's more than just Effect bindings\! Confect allows you to:

- Define your Convex database schema using Effect schemas.
- Use Confect functions to automatically decode and encode your data according to your Effect Schema definitions when reading from and writing to the database.
- Write Convex function args and returns validators using Effect's Schema library.
- Use Effect-ified versions of all of the Convex server APIs (`Promise`s become `Effect`s, `A | nulls` becomes `Option<A>`s, etc.).

It's recommended that you have some familiarity with both Effect and Convex, including the vanilla `convex-js` APIs, before getting started with Confect.
