## 9.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 445ea9b: Loosen and align dependency ranges across all packages:

  - The `convex` peer dependency is now `^1.32.0` in every package (previously pinned exactly to `1.39.1`, or `^1.30.0` in `@confect/react`). The range is validated against convex 1.32.0 through 1.40.0.
  - `@confect/server`'s `@effect/platform-node` peer dependency is now optional — it is only needed when using the `@confect/server/node` entrypoint.
  - `@confect/cli` now uses caret ranges for its `@effect/platform` and `@effect/platform-node` dependencies so they can deduplicate with the versions resolved for `@confect/server`, and no longer declares an unused direct dependency on `@effect/platform-node-shared`.
  - `@confect/test` now accepts any `convex-test` release in `>=0.0.50 <0.1.0` instead of exactly 0.0.50.

### Major Changes

- a905072: Rearchitect Confect so that cold-starting a Convex function only evaluates its own group's module graph, cutting cold-start execution time on large projects. The change touches how you author tables, specs, and impls, and removes the project-wide aggregation that used to make every function evaluate every other function's code—and every table's schema—the first time it ran.

  Convex bundles a deployment into a single artifact, but a function's cold start only _evaluates_ the module graph reachable from its own entry point. Previously, all impls were assembled into a single root `confect/impl.ts` that every generated `convex/` module imported, so cold-starting any one query, mutation, or action transitively evaluated the impl of every other function in the project, plus every function spec and every table schema, at module-load time. Cold-start execution time scaled with the size of the whole project. In v9, `confect codegen` emits one registry per group and each generated `convex/` module imports only its own group—so a function's cold-start work scales with its own group, not the project.

  ### Filesystem-driven groups

  Your API is now authored as colocated `*.spec.ts`/`*.impl.ts` pairs, one pair per group, and **the file's path within `confect/` is the group's name** (its stem for top-level groups, the dot-joined directory path for nested groups). `GroupSpec.make()` and `GroupSpec.makeNode()` no longer take a name argument.

  - Each `*.spec.ts` `export default`s its `GroupSpec` (named co-exports like error classes are still allowed).
  - Each `*.impl.ts` default-imports its sibling spec, passes it to `FunctionImpl.make` / `GroupImpl.make`, and ends the layer pipeline with `GroupImpl.finalize`—a compile-time completeness check that only typechecks once every function the spec declares has a `FunctionImpl` provided.
  - The root `confect/spec.ts`, `confect/impl.ts`, `confect/nodeSpec.ts`, and `confect/nodeImpl.ts` files are gone, along with `Impl.make` and `Impl.finalize`. `confect codegen` deletes any of these (and the stale aggregate `_generated/registeredFunctions.ts` / `_generated/nodeRegisteredFunctions.ts`) on upgrade.

  ### Tables are the source of truth, named by their filename

  Your schema now lives entirely in `confect/tables/`, one `Table` per file, and **the filename is the table name**—`confect/tables/notes.ts` defines the `notes` table. `Table.make` no longer takes a name argument. The user-authored `confect/schema.ts` is removed; codegen scans `confect/tables/*.ts` and generates everything else.

  Each table file is a default-export-only module, and its field schema is wrapped in a `() =>` callback so it is built lazily—a function only pays a table's schema-construction cost at cold start for tables it actually reads.

  ```ts confect/tables/notes.ts
  import { Table } from "@confect/server";
  import { Schema } from "effect";
  import { Id } from "../_generated/id";

  export default Table.make(() =>
    Schema.Struct({
      userId: Schema.optional(Id("users")),
      text: Schema.String,
    })
  );
  ```

  Codegen emits, alongside it:

  - `_generated/schema.ts`—the runtime `DatabaseSchema`. Never imports `convex/server`, so a runtime cold start no longer evaluates `defineSchema(...)`.
  - `_generated/convexSchema.ts`—the Convex deploy `SchemaDefinition`, re-exported from `convex/schema.ts`.
  - `_generated/id.ts`—a type-safe `Id` constructor whose argument is constrained to your table names. Use `Id("notes")` everywhere you previously wrote `GenericId.GenericId("notes")`; cross-table `_id` typos are now caught at compile time.
  - `_generated/tables/<name>.ts`—a thin wrapper that binds the filename to the table. Read a table's `Doc`, `Fields`, and `tableName` from this wrapper (`import notes from "../_generated/tables/notes"`), not from `confect/tables/`.

  A bound table's `name` property is renamed to `tableName` (avoiding a collision with `Function.prototype.name`).

  ### Specs and impls: lazy schemas, and impls take the `DatabaseSchema`

  `FunctionSpec.*` constructors now take `args`, `returns`, and the optional `error` as `() => Schema` thunks, so importing a spec builds no schemas until a function is invoked. `FunctionImpl.make` and `GroupImpl.make` take the runtime `DatabaseSchema` (the default export of `_generated/schema`) as their first argument instead of the whole `Api`—which keeps the project-wide spec graph out of a function's cold-start module graph. The `Api` module (`Api.make`, the `Api` type) and the generated `_generated/api.ts` / `_generated/nodeApi.ts` files are removed.

  **Before:**

  ```ts confect/notes.spec.ts
  export const notes = GroupSpec.make("notes").addFunction(
    FunctionSpec.publicQuery({
      name: "list",
      args: Schema.Struct({}),
      returns: Schema.Array(Notes.Doc),
    })
  );
  ```

  ```ts confect/notes.impl.ts
  const list = FunctionImpl.make(api, "notes", "list", handler);
  export const notes = GroupImpl.make(api, "notes").pipe(Layer.provide(list));
  ```

  **After:**

  ```ts confect/notes.spec.ts
  import notes from "./_generated/tables/notes";

  export default GroupSpec.make().addFunction(
    FunctionSpec.publicQuery({
      name: "list",
      args: () => Schema.Struct({}),
      returns: () => Schema.Array(notes.Doc),
    })
  );
  ```

  ```ts confect/notes.impl.ts
  import databaseSchema from "./_generated/schema";
  import notes from "./notes.spec";

  const list = FunctionImpl.make(databaseSchema, notes, "list", handler);
  export default GroupImpl.make(databaseSchema, notes).pipe(
    Layer.provide(list),
    GroupImpl.finalize
  );
  ```

  ### Node functions are first-class

  A group's runtime is now declared solely by its spec—`GroupSpec.makeNode()` for a Node action group, `GroupSpec.make()` otherwise—mirroring vanilla Convex's per-file `"use node"` directive. The separate `node` namespace is gone: Node specs/impls are ordinary colocated pairs that can live anywhere in `confect/`, and codegen emits the `"use node"` directive based on the spec.

  - A Node group at `confect/email.spec.ts` is now reached at `refs.public.email.send` instead of `refs.public.node.email.send`.
  - `@confect/core` removes `Spec.makeNode`, `Spec.merge`, and `Spec.isConvexSpec` / `Spec.isNodeSpec`; `Spec.make()` is a single mixed-runtime container and `Refs.make(spec)` takes one argument. `GroupSpec.makeNode()`, `FunctionSpec.publicNodeAction()` / `internalNodeAction()` are unchanged.

  ### Less work at cold start

  Confect's own packages now import Effect from its submodule paths (`import * as Schema from "effect/Schema"`) instead of the `"effect"` barrel. A barrel import of a namespace re-export pulls the entire namespace into the module graph a function evaluates at cold start, even when only a small part is used; importing the submodule path evaluates only what's needed. On a minimal function this cut cold-start module-evaluation time by ~35%. This is an internal change with no effect on your code—but to get the full win, import Effect from its submodule paths in your own `confect/` files too, since a single barrel import anywhere in a function's module graph re-pins the whole namespace.

  ### Stable React hook results

  `@confect/react` hooks now hold stable identities across renders, matching Convex's own hooks. `useQuery` memoizes the decoded `QueryResult` by the (referentially stable) Convex result, so unchanged data keeps the same `QueryResult` instead of a fresh one each render—fixing effect/memo loops (including `Maximum update depth exceeded`) for code that derives off the result. `useMutation` and `useAction` return a stable `useCallback`, and `Ref.getFunctionReference` caches the Convex function reference per function name.

  ### Codegen robustness

  The codegen bundler now uses [`bundle-require`](https://github.com/egoist/bundle-require), so impls may import third-party packages and use `tsconfig.json` `paths` aliases (`~/*`, `@/*`, …) for their own source. A parent `confect/{path}.spec.ts` may now declare functions alongside a sibling `confect/{path}/` subdirectory of further specs, and codegen reports a clear error on a name collision between the two.

  ### Migration

  1. **Tables.** Delete `confect/schema.ts`. Rename each table file to a valid JS identifier (e.g. `confect/tables/notes.ts`); the basename becomes the table name. Drop the name argument from `Table.make`, wrap the field struct in `() =>`, and replace `GenericId.GenericId("x")` with `Id("x")` from `_generated/id`. If you read `table.name` off a bound table, rename it to `table.tableName`.
  2. **Specs.** Split each group into a colocated `*.spec.ts` that `export default`s `GroupSpec.make()` (no name). Wrap every `args`/`returns`/`error` in `() =>`. Import a table's `Doc`/`Fields` from its wrapper, `import notes from "./_generated/tables/notes"`.
  3. **Impls.** In each `*.impl.ts`, default-import the sibling spec, import `databaseSchema` from `_generated/schema`, pass it to `FunctionImpl.make` / `GroupImpl.make` in place of `api`, end the pipeline with `GroupImpl.finalize`, and `export default` it. Delete the root `confect/spec.ts`, `impl.ts`, `nodeSpec.ts`, and `nodeImpl.ts` (codegen will also remove them).
  4. **Node groups.** Move any `confect/node/<path>` files anywhere you like under `confect/`; the `node/` directory no longer has special meaning. Drop the `node` segment from call sites (`refs.public.node.<group>` → `refs.public.<group>`) and replace `Refs.make(spec, nodeSpec)` with `Refs.make(spec)`.
  5. **Tests.** If you use `@confect/test`, import `confectSchema` from `_generated/schema`, import the generated `convexSchema` from `_generated/convexSchema`, and pass `convexSchema` as the new second argument to `TestConfect.layer`.
  6. **Optional.** Adopt submodule Effect imports (`import * as Schema from "effect/Schema"`) in your own `confect/` files for the full cold-start savings.
  7. Run `confect codegen`. It re-emits the entire `convex/` tree and `confect/_generated/`, deleting any stale files from earlier versions.

### Patch Changes

- ecb3b69: Package `@confect/cli` as a binary-only package: the `.` export—along with the `main`, `module`, and `types` fields—is removed, and no type declarations are published.

  `@confect/cli` has no public API; its entry module is the `confect` bin script itself. The removed `.` export was both broken (it pointed at `./dist/index.js`, while the build emits `./dist/index.mjs`) and hazardous (importing the entry module would have executed the CLI, since the script runs at module top level). Nothing changes for the supported usage: running the `confect` binary.

### Major Changes

- 4894959: Make Node-runtime functions first-class and remove the separate `node` namespace.

  A function group's runtime is now declared solely by its spec — `GroupSpec.makeNode()` for a Node action group, `GroupSpec.make()` for a Convex group — exactly like vanilla Convex's per-file `"use node"` directive. The `confect/node/` directory is no longer special: Node specs/impls are ordinary colocated `.spec.ts`/`.impl.ts` pairs that can live anywhere in `confect/`, and codegen emits the `"use node"` directive into the generated `convex/` module based on the spec. This is safe because v9's per-group registries already isolate each Convex function's bundle from every other group's impl, so Node-only code can no longer leak into a Convex-runtime bundle regardless of namespace.

  ### Why

  The `node` namespace existed only because the pre-v9 architecture aggregated every function's impl into one module that all generated `convex/` modules imported; Node functions had to be quarantined into a separate spec/impl/registry tree so Convex-runtime functions wouldn't transitively import Node-only code. v9's per-group isolation removed that constraint, so the namespace was no longer load-bearing — only ergonomic overhead that diverged from vanilla Convex (which identifies Node modules per-file, with no directory requirement).

  ### Breaking changes

  - **API namespace removed.** A Node group at `confect/email.spec.ts` is now referenced as `refs.public.email.send` instead of `refs.public.node.email.send`. Node groups are ordinary groups in the refs tree, nesting preserved like any other group.
  - **Generated layout changed.** Node modules are emitted at `convex/<path>.ts` (carrying `"use node"`) instead of `convex/node/<path>.ts`, and their registries at `confect/_generated/registeredFunctions/<path>.ts`. The single assembled `confect/_generated/spec.ts` now contains every group regardless of runtime; `confect/_generated/nodeSpec.ts` is no longer generated (codegen deletes any stale copy on upgrade).
  - **`@confect/core` API.** Removed `Spec.makeNode`, `Spec.merge`, and `Spec.isConvexSpec`/`Spec.isNodeSpec`. `Spec` is now a single mixed-runtime container (`Spec.make()` accepts groups of any runtime). `Refs.make(spec)` takes a single argument (the unified spec) instead of `(convexSpec, nodeSpec)`. `GroupSpec.makeNode()`/`makeNodeAt()` and `FunctionSpec.publicNodeAction()`/`internalNodeAction()` are unchanged; `GroupSpec` subgroups may now be of any runtime (a group is just a namespace for its children).

  ### Migration

  1. Move any `confect/node/<path>.spec.ts`/`.impl.ts` files to wherever you want them under `confect/` (e.g. `confect/<path>.spec.ts`); the `node/` directory has no special meaning anymore. Their specs already use `GroupSpec.makeNode()`, so no spec-body change is needed — only fix the impl's relative import of `_generated/schema` if its depth changed.
  2. Update call sites to drop the `node` segment: `refs.public.node.<group>.<fn>` → `refs.public.<group>.<fn>`.
  3. Replace `Refs.make(spec, nodeSpec)` with `Refs.make(spec)` (codegen does this for `_generated/refs.ts` automatically).
  4. Run `confect codegen`. The `convex/` tree and `confect/_generated/` are re-emitted; the stale `_generated/nodeSpec.ts` is removed.

## 9.0.0-next.8

### Patch Changes

- 3fec285: Import Effect from its submodule paths internally to shrink per-function cold-start bundles.

  Confect's packages now import Effect modules from their submodule paths (`import * as Schema from "effect/Schema"`) instead of the `"effect"` barrel (`import { Schema } from "effect"`).

  ### Why

  A barrel import of a namespace re-export defeats esbuild's tree-shaking: accessing `Schema.X` from `import { Schema } from "effect"` retains the _entire_ `Schema` namespace, because the bundler can't prune property access on the barrel's `export * as Schema`. So every Convex function's cold-start bundle was pulling all of `effect/Schema` and `effect/Stream` — and, transitively through Schema's `Arbitrary`, `fast-check` — whether the function used them or not.

  Importing from the submodule path tree-shakes normally. On a minimal function this cut the bundle esbuild produces by ~54% (the `effect/Schema` module alone by ~75%) and its cold-start module-evaluation time by ~35%, with `fast-check` dropped entirely. This is also the import style Effect v4 recommends, so it's forward-compatible. A `no-restricted-imports` ESLint rule now enforces it across the codebase (type-only imports and `@effect/vitest` are exempt).

  No API changes — your existing code keeps working.

  ### Getting the full win in your own code

  This change shrinks the Confect code in every function bundle, but a function's bundle also includes your own `confect/tables/*` and `*.spec.ts` files. esbuild retains the union across all importers, so a single barrel import anywhere in a function's module graph re-pins the whole `effect/Schema` namespace and undoes the reduction. To get the full bundle/cold-start savings, import Effect from its submodule paths in your own Confect files too:

  ```diff
  - import { Schema } from "effect";
  + import * as Schema from "effect/Schema";
  ```

  Bare helpers (`pipe`, `flow`, `identity`) come from `"effect/Function"`.

## 9.0.0-next.6

### Major Changes

- 46045a9: Reduce per-function cold-start cost: make `FunctionSpec` schemas lazy and keep each Convex function's bundle scoped to its own group.

  Previously, loading a single Convex function still paid for the whole project — importing the codegen-assembled `_generated/spec.ts` ran `Schema.Struct(...)` / `Schema.Array(...)` for every function at module load, and each per-function bundle transitively imported `_generated/api.ts` → `_generated/spec.ts` (every spec). A function's cold-start cost now scales with its own group rather than the size of the project.

  ### Lazy `FunctionSpec` schemas

  `FunctionSpec.*` (`publicQuery` / `internalQuery` / `publicMutation` / `internalMutation` / `publicAction` / `internalAction` / `publicNodeAction` / `internalNodeAction`) takes `args`, `returns`, and (optional) `error` as `() => Schema` thunks instead of bare schemas. The resulting provenance exposes them as sync lazy memoised getters (the same pattern `Table.make` uses), so importing `_generated/spec.ts` builds no schemas — construction is deferred to the first invocation that compiles validators or runs a codec.

  Migration — wrap each schema in `() =>`:

  ```diff
    FunctionSpec.publicQuery({
      name: "list",
  -   args: Schema.Struct({}),
  -   returns: Schema.Array(notes.Doc),
  +   args: () => Schema.Struct({}),
  +   returns: () => Schema.Array(notes.Doc),
    })
  ```

  ### Impls take the `DatabaseSchema`, and group paths resolve impl-side

  `FunctionImpl.make` and `GroupImpl.make` now take the runtime `DatabaseSchema` (the default export of `_generated/schema.ts`) as their first argument instead of the whole `Api`. The handler's ctx-service types only ever depended on the database schema, and switching impls to import `_generated/schema` instead of `_generated/api` removes `_generated/spec.ts` (and the function specs it transitively imports) from every per-function bundle.

  Each function also registers under a flat, single-segment key into a fresh, isolated `Registry` provided per group by `RegisteredFunctions.buildForGroup` (and the CLI's impl validation), so no group-path lookup against `api.spec` is needed. As a result `Spec#addPath`, `Spec#paths`, and `Api.resolveGroupPathUnsafe` are removed; `GroupImpl` / `FunctionImpl` drop their group-path type parameter; and the codegen-emitted `_generated/spec.ts` / `nodeSpec.ts` no longer contain a `.addPath(...)` chain (the `.addAt(...)` / `.addGroupAt(...)` assembly tree that `Refs.make` consumes is unchanged).

  Migration — in each `*.impl.ts`, import the database schema and pass it where you passed `api` / `nodeApi`:

  ```diff
  - import api from "../_generated/api";        // (or nodeApi from "../_generated/nodeApi")
  + import databaseSchema from "../_generated/schema";

  - const insert = FunctionImpl.make(api, notes, "insert", handler);
  + const insert = FunctionImpl.make(databaseSchema, notes, "insert", handler);

  - export default GroupImpl.make(api, notes).pipe(Layer.provide(insert), GroupImpl.finalize);
  + export default GroupImpl.make(databaseSchema, notes).pipe(Layer.provide(insert), GroupImpl.finalize);
  ```

  Node impls migrate identically (from `nodeApi` to the same `_generated/schema`); only their specs differ (`GroupSpec.makeNode()`). Hand-rolled tests that built a `Spec` via `.addPath(group, "dot.path")` should drop those calls.

  ### `buildForGroup` and the generated registries

  `RegisteredFunctions.buildForGroup` takes the `DatabaseSchema` value plus the group's own `GroupSpec` as a single type argument (`buildForGroup<typeof groupSpec>(…)`, returning `RegisteredFunctionsForGroupSpec<Group>`); the `api` / `groupPath` parameters and the `ForGroupPath` dot-path navigation are gone. `RegisteredConvexFunction.make` / `RegisteredNodeFunction.make` take the `DatabaseSchema` rather than the `Api`. Each `_generated/registeredFunctions/{path}.ts` imports the runtime schema and references its group's leaf spec **type-only** (`typeof import("…/{group}.spec")["default"]`), so it never imports a spec module at runtime.

  ### `_generated/api.ts` / `nodeApi.ts` are no longer emitted, and `Api` is removed

  Nothing imports them anymore, so `confect codegen` no longer emits `_generated/api.ts` / `_generated/nodeApi.ts` and deletes any copies left over from earlier versions. The `Api` module itself (`@confect/server/Api` — `Api.make`, the `Api` type, `Api.resolveGroupPathUnsafe`, etc.) is **removed entirely**: impls and the generated registries take the `DatabaseSchema` value and the spec directly, so the combined database-schema-plus-spec `Api` is no longer used anywhere.

  ### Net effect

  A function's `convex/{path}.ts` bundle now imports only its own group's registry → its own `.impl` + `_generated/schema` (table schemas, built lazily) + its own group's spec. No `_generated/api.ts`, no project-wide `_generated/spec.ts`, and no sibling-group impls/specs. Re-run `confect codegen` after upgrading.

- 762f7eb: Split the deploy-time Convex schema from the runtime `DatabaseSchema`, make `confect/tables/` the single source of truth — including the table name, which is now derived from the filename — and make per-table schema construction lazy.

  Previously, `confect/schema.ts` was user-authored and `DatabaseSchema` carried a `convexSchemaDefinition` field that was eagerly rebuilt on every `.addTable(...)`. That field was an `O(n²)` allocation for `n` tables, and it forced both the deploy CLI (which only needs `defineSchema(...)`) and the runtime (which only needs the table codec lookup) through the same module — so any runtime function bundle dragged in `convex/server`'s `defineSchema`. Issue 1.

  Codegen now scans `confect/tables/*.ts` (every file must default-export a `Table`) and emits two siblings:

  - `confect/_generated/schema.ts` — the runtime `DatabaseSchema`, consumed by `_generated/api.ts`. Imports `@confect/server` but never `convex/server`.
  - `confect/_generated/convexSchema.ts` — the Convex deploy `SchemaDefinition`, re-exported one-line from `convex/schema.ts`. Imports `convex/server` but never `@confect/server`.

  The `convexSchemaDefinition` field is removed from `DatabaseSchema` and `Api`. `TestConfect.layer` now takes the Convex schema definition as a separate argument so it can stay aligned with the deploy artifact without bringing the runtime schema along for the ride.

  ### Filename-derived table names

  The table name is now derived from the file's basename — `confect/tables/notes.ts` defines a table called `notes`. `Table.make` no longer accepts a name argument and returns an _unnamed_ `Table` value; codegen invokes that value with the filename to produce the bound table.

  This eliminates a class of subtle infelicities: the file basename and the table name can never drift out of sync, cross-table `_id` references are type-constrained against the actual set of declared tables (catching typos at compile time), and ESM cycle hazards for mutual cross-table `Id` references are gone because authoring files no longer transitively import each other.

  Codegen now emits two new sets of files alongside `_generated/schema.ts` and `_generated/convexSchema.ts`:

  - `confect/_generated/id.ts` — a single `Id` constructor whose argument is type-constrained to the union of your table names. Use `Id("notes")` everywhere you previously wrote `GenericId.GenericId("notes")`.
  - `confect/_generated/tables/<name>.ts` — one thin wrapper per table that binds the unnamed value from `confect/tables/<name>.ts` to its filename. This is what other modules (specs, impls, HTTP handlers) default-import to reach a table's `Doc`, `Fields`, and `tableName`.

  Table filenames must be valid JS identifiers, may not start with `_` (Convex reserves underscore-prefixed names for system tables), and may not collide with reserved JS keywords like `import.ts`. Pick a casing convention you like — Confect's example code uses `snake_case` (`notes.ts`, `user_profiles.ts`).

  The bound `Table`'s `name` property has been renamed to `tableName`. This avoids a silent collision with the built-in `Function.prototype.name` that JavaScript carries on every function value (including the new unnamed-callable `UnnamedTable`).

  ### Lazy per-table schema construction

  `Table.make` takes a `() => Schema.Struct({...})` callback rather than a bare struct, and a bound `Table`'s `Fields`, `Doc`, and `tableDefinition` are lazy memoised getters that only invoke that callback on first access.

  Previously, every `confect/tables/<name>.ts` module ran `Schema.Struct({...})` (and the corresponding `compileTableSchema` / `defineTable` work) at module-load time. Because the codegen-emitted `_generated/schema.ts` is imported transitively from every per-group function bundle, loading any one function eagerly built _every_ table's schema graph — paying a cold-start cost proportional to the whole project, not just the function being invoked.

  The bound `Table` now exposes `Fields` / `Doc` / `tableDefinition` as lazy getters that compute their value on first access, then replace themselves with a plain non-writable data property so second-and-subsequent accesses are observably indistinguishable from a plain property (and skip all function-call overhead). The result: a function bundle only pays the schema-construction cost for tables it actually touches via `db.table(name)` (which reaches `Fields` through `Document.decode`). The `UnnamedTable` callable no longer exposes `Fields` or `tableDefinition` — read these off the bound `Table` (the generated `_generated/tables/<name>.ts` wrapper already binds the name).

  ### Migration

  1. Delete your `confect/schema.ts`. Codegen will refuse to run while a stray copy is present.
  2. Rename each `confect/tables/<Name>.ts` to a valid JS identifier in your chosen casing convention (e.g. `confect/tables/notes.ts`). The basename becomes the table name; you no longer pass it as an argument.
  3. Convert each table file to a **default-export-only** unnamed module: drop the name argument from `Table.make`, wrap the field-schema struct in a `() => ...` callback, and switch any `GenericId.GenericId("users")` references to `Id("users")` imported from `../_generated/id`:

     ```diff
     - import { GenericId } from "@confect/core";
       import { Table } from "@confect/server";
       import { Schema } from "effect";
     + import { Id } from "../_generated/id";

     - export default Table.make(
     -   "notes",
     -   Schema.Struct({
     -     userId: Schema.optional(GenericId.GenericId("users")),
     -     text: Schema.String,
     -   }),
     - );
     + export default Table.make(() =>
     +   Schema.Struct({
     +     userId: Schema.optional(Id("users")),
     +     text: Schema.String,
     +   }),
     + );
     ```

  4. Rewire every consumer site (specs, impls, integration tests, HTTP handlers, etc.) to import from the generated wrapper rather than directly from `tables/`. The wrapper is also where you now read `Doc` / `Fields` / `tableDefinition` (the unnamed `Table.make(...)` callable no longer exposes them):

     ```diff
     - import Notes from "../tables/Notes";
     + import notes from "../_generated/tables/notes";

     - returns: Schema.Array(Notes.Doc),
     + returns: Schema.Array(notes.Doc),
     ```

  5. Replace every remaining `GenericId.GenericId("x")` call site with `Id("x")` from `_generated/id` (in spec `args`/`returns`, in `TaggedError` schemas, in `TestConfect.run`, etc.).
  6. If you read `table.name` anywhere off a bound `Table`, rename it to `table.tableName`.
  7. Re-run `confect codegen`. It will create `confect/_generated/schema.ts`, `confect/_generated/convexSchema.ts`, `confect/_generated/id.ts`, and one `confect/_generated/tables/<name>.ts` wrapper per table; and it will rewrite `convex/schema.ts` to a one-line re-export.
  8. If you use `@confect/test`, pass the generated Convex schema definition to `TestConfect.layer`:

     ```diff
     - import confectSchema from "./confect/schema";
     + import confectSchema from "./confect/_generated/schema";
     + import convexSchema from "./confect/_generated/convexSchema";

       export const layer = TestConfect_.layer(
         confectSchema,
     +   convexSchema,
         import.meta.glob("./convex/**/!(*.*.*)*.*s"),
       );
     ```

  ### New warning: no tables discovered

  If a Confect project has no tables — either `confect/tables/` is missing entirely or it exists but contains no `.ts` files — codegen now emits a yellow `⚠` warning and continues, producing an empty `DatabaseSchema.make()` / `defineSchema({})`. Table-free backends (e.g. action-only proxies, webhook bridges) are still legal; the warning just catches the much more common case of a typoed directory name or files placed at the wrong path. To silence it, add at least one `Table.make(...)` module under `confect/tables/`.

  ### New error: invalid table filename

  Codegen now rejects table files whose basename is not a valid JS identifier (e.g. `user-profiles.ts`), starts with `_` (reserved for Convex system tables), or shadows a reserved JS keyword (e.g. `import.ts`). Rename the offending file to fix it — for example, `user-profiles.ts` → `user_profiles.ts` or `userProfiles.ts`.

## 9.0.0-next.5

### Patch Changes

- 4cebebc: Switch the codegen bundler to [`bundle-require`](https://github.com/egoist/bundle-require).

  ### Why

  `9.0.0-next.4`'s `absoluteExternalsPlugin` externalized every bare-specifier import and rewrote it to a `file://` URL because the bundle was loaded via a parent-less `data:` URL. esbuild's resolver honors `tsconfig.json#compilerOptions.paths`, so a `~/src/foo`-style alias resolved to a local `.ts` file and got externalized as `file:///…/foo.ts` — which Node ESM cannot import (`ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION`). The codegen bundler hand-rolled a third reimplementation of "load a TypeScript config file at runtime"; each iteration introduced a new bug.

  ### What changed

  - `@confect/cli/Bundler` now delegates to `bundle-require`, the library `tsup`, `unbuild`, `vite`, `vitest`, and `vuepress` use for this exact problem. `bundle-require` writes a temp `.mjs` next to the source, `import()`s it, and deletes it — so bare-specifier externals (third-party packages, workspace deps) resolve through Node's normal `node_modules` walk and tsconfig `paths` aliases stay inside the bundle.
  - `@confect/cli/confect/dev`'s watcher swaps `absoluteExternalsPlugin` for `bundle-require`'s `externalPlugin`, fed the project's `tsconfig.json#paths` via `loadTsConfig` so dev-mode rebuilds also bundle aliased local source instead of erroring on it.
  - The `absoluteExternalsPlugin` export is removed from `@confect/cli/Bundler`.

  ### Fixes

  - Restores `confect codegen` for any project that uses `tsconfig.json` `paths` aliases (e.g. `~/*`, `@/*`, `@app/*`) for its own source.
  - As a side benefit, `__dirname`, `__filename`, and `import.meta.url` inside bundled impls now resolve to the original source path instead of the temporary bundle URL (`bundle-require`'s built-in injection).

  - @confect/server@9.0.0-next.5

## 9.0.0-next.4

### Patch Changes

- 46e17f7: Externalize every bare-specifier dependency during codegen bundling instead of inlining third-party packages.

  ### Why

  Since `9.0.0-next.0`, codegen bundles each `*.impl.ts` with esbuild so it can load the default-exported `Layer` and read the snapshotted function names from a `Finalized` `GroupImpl`. The bundler only marked `@confect/core`, `@confect/server`, `effect`, and `@effect/*` as external — every other dependency, including all of `node_modules` and every `node:*` built-in reached through inlined CJS source, was bundled into the output. With `format: "esm"`, esbuild rewrites any CJS `require(...)` in that inlined source to a runtime shim that throws `Dynamic require of "<id>" is not supported`, so any impl importing a third-party package (`sharp`, `luxon`, `@clerk/backend`, `jsonwebtoken`, `openai`, etc.) failed during `validateImpl`.

  ### What changed

  - `@confect/cli/Bundler`'s `absoluteExternalsPlugin` now externalizes every bare specifier (anything not starting with `./`, `../`, or `/`), resolving each to an absolute file URL via the user's `node_modules`. `node:*` built-ins pass through unchanged.
  - The `EXTERNAL_PACKAGES` allow-list is removed; relative imports continue to be bundled so the user's own source is still transpiled together.
  - `@confect/cli/confect/dev` drops the redundant `external: EXTERNAL_PACKAGES` esbuild option — the plugin handles externalization for both codegen and dev-mode watchers.

  ### Fixes

  This restores `confect codegen` for impls that import any non-`@confect/*` / `effect` / `@effect/*` library, fixing the regression introduced in `9.0.0-next.0`.

  - @confect/core@9.0.0-next.4
  - @confect/server@9.0.0-next.4

## 9.0.0-next.3

### Patch Changes

- 6d85210: Resolve `FunctionImpl` / `GroupImpl` group paths via an immutable `paths` map on `Spec` instead of identity-walking the assembled tree.

  ### Why

  Since `9.0.0-next.1`, codegen has wrapped every parent leaf that has sibling subdirectory specs in `<parent>.addGroupAt("child", <child>)`. Because `GroupSpec.addGroupAt` is immutable, that produced a fresh object in the assembled tree, while the parent's `*.impl.ts` continued to hold a reference to the original imported leaf. The runtime resolver compared by `===`, so every such impl failed `validateImpl` with "Could not resolve group path for the provided GroupSpec." Child impls happened to work only because `GroupSpec.withName` was secretly mutating its argument in place to keep the child's identity stable — an asymmetry that was load-bearing for one half of the API and broken for the other.

  ### What changed

  - `@confect/core/Spec` carries a new `readonly paths: ReadonlyMap<GroupSpec.AnyWithProps, string>` field and exposes a chainable `Spec#addPath(group, path)` builder. `add` / `addAt` / `merge` propagate `paths` unchanged; `merge` re-prefixes a node spec's entries with `"node."` to match the merged tree.
  - `@confect/core/GroupSpec.withName` is now pure: it returns a fresh copy when the name differs and no longer rewrites the input in place. No new identity-tracking machinery is introduced.
  - `@confect/server/FunctionImpl.make` and `GroupImpl.make` resolve their group path via `api.spec.paths.get(group)` — an O(1) map lookup instead of a tree walk — and throw a clearer error pointing at `Spec.addPath` when the spec hasn't been registered.
  - `@confect/server/GroupPath` (the old identity-based resolver) is deleted.
  - `@confect/cli` codegen emits one `.addPath(<binding>, "<dot.path>")` call per leaf in `_generated/spec.ts` (and `_generated/nodeSpec.ts`) so the imported leaves carry their full paths into the assembled spec value.

  ### User-facing impact

  - Spec authoring (`*.spec.ts`) and impl authoring (`*.impl.ts`) APIs are unchanged. `FunctionImpl.make(api, spec, name, handler)` and `GroupImpl.make(api, spec)` keep their exact signatures.
  - Generated `_generated/spec.ts` (and `_generated/nodeSpec.ts`) pick up one `.addPath(...)` chain entry per leaf on the next `confect codegen` run. The shape is fully immutable — no module-load mutation, no hidden side effects.
  - Hand-rolled tests that construct a `Spec` and pass it to `Api.make` must now also call `.addPath(spec, "dot.path")` for any group they intend to look up.

  ### Fixes

  This eliminates the runtime regression introduced in `9.0.0-next.1` for any project layout where a `confect/{path}.spec.ts` declares functions alongside a sibling `confect/{path}/` subdirectory of further specs.

  - @confect/core@9.0.0-next.3
  - @confect/server@9.0.0-next.3

## 9.0.0-next.2

### Patch Changes

- bf13919: Generate a unique import binding per spec leaf in `_generated/spec.ts`, even when sibling `*.spec.ts` files share a basename across directories.

  Previously, codegen keyed import bindings by file basename (the filename minus `.spec.ts`). When two leaves shared a basename they collapsed to a single binding, last write wins. Every `addGroupAt(...)` site that should have referenced any of the colliding leaves ended up referencing the same survivor, and every impl whose sibling spec was dropped failed `validateImpl` with `Could not resolve group path for the provided GroupSpec.` because the assembled tree no longer contained that spec object's identity.

  Each binding now carries its own `localName` derived from the leaf's full path segments (e.g. `scripts_operational_seed_mutations`), used both as the imported identifier and at the matching `addGroupAt` site. Top-level leaves with single-segment paths are unchanged (`env`, `notes`, etc.).

  - @confect/core@9.0.0-next.2
  - @confect/server@9.0.0-next.2

## 9.0.0-next.1

### Patch Changes

- 7cb20ab: Allow a `confect/{path}.spec.ts` file to declare functions even when a sibling `confect/{path}/` subdirectory contains further specs.

  Previously, every function on the parent spec silently disappeared from the generated api and refs in this layout: `refs.{path}.{fn}` was not defined, while `refs.{path}.{child}.{fn}` (from the subdirectory specs) worked. The parent's `*.impl.ts` continued to type-check on its own, so the missing functions only showed up when something tried to call them.

  Both `confect codegen` and `confect dev` now generate the parent's functions and the subdirectory's groups side by side, as `refs.{path}.{fn}` and `refs.{path}.{child}.{fn}`.

  Codegen also now reports a clear error when the parent spec declares a function or subgroup whose name matches one of the subdirectory's child segments, rather than letting the conflict turn into a runtime refs collision. `confect codegen` exits non-zero on this error; `confect dev` logs it and keeps watching so the next save can recover.

  - @confect/core@9.0.0-next.1
  - @confect/server@9.0.0-next.1

## 9.0.0-next.0

### Major Changes

- 6db3a3a: Derive Confect function paths from the filesystem layout of `confect/`. Each group lives in a colocated `*.spec.ts`/`*.impl.ts` pair, and the group's name is its path within `confect/` (file stem for top-level groups, dot-joined directory path for nested groups). See [Project Structure](https://confect.dev/concepts/project-structure), [File Naming Conventions](https://confect.dev/concepts/file-naming-conventions), and [The Spec/Impl Model](https://confect.dev/concepts/spec-impl-model) for the current model.

  Each `*.spec.ts` default-exports its `GroupSpec`. Each `*.impl.ts` default-imports its sibling spec, builds its `GroupImpl`, and default-exports the result of `GroupImpl.finalize`. Named co-exports on `*.spec.ts` (such as error classes) remain allowed.

  ### Why

  The previous model assembled every group's impl into a single root `confect/impl.ts` (plus `confect/nodeImpl.ts`), which `confect codegen` emitted as the aggregate `_generated/registeredFunctions.ts`. Every generated `convex/` module — one per Convex function — imported from that aggregate, so loading any single query, mutation, or action transitively loaded the impl module of every other Convex function in the project, along with all of their dependencies. For large projects this inflated each function's bundle and added meaningful cold-start cost on Convex.

  Splitting impl across colocated `*.impl.ts` files is the vehicle for fixing that. With this change, `confect codegen` emits one `_generated/registeredFunctions/{path}.ts` per group, and each generated `convex/` module imports only its own group's per-group registry — which in turn imports only its own sibling `.impl.ts`. A Convex function's cold-start bundle now scales with its own group's impl rather than with the size of the whole project.

  ### Breaking changes

  - `GroupSpec.make()` and `GroupSpec.makeNode()` no longer take a name argument; the group name is derived from the spec file's path within `confect/`.
  - `FunctionImpl.make(api, groupSpec, fn, handler)` and `GroupImpl.make(api, groupSpec)` now take the imported sibling spec object as their second argument instead of a dot-path string.
  - Every `GroupImpl` pipeline must end with `GroupImpl.finalize`, which only typechecks once every function declared by the spec has a corresponding `FunctionImpl` provided to the group layer. `GroupImpl.finalize` snapshots the names of every registered function onto the produced `Finalized` `GroupImpl` service value, and `confect codegen` reads those names to verify per-function coverage against the spec at runtime.
  - The previously-exported `Impl.make` and `Impl.finalize` (used by the old root `impl.ts`/`nodeImpl.ts` files) are removed. Per-group completeness is now enforced by `GroupImpl.finalize`.
  - Root `confect/spec.ts`, `confect/impl.ts`, `confect/nodeSpec.ts`, `confect/nodeImpl.ts`, and any parent aggregator `*.spec.ts`/`*.impl.ts` files are no longer used. `confect codegen` deletes any of these on upgrade, along with the stale `_generated/registeredFunctions.ts` and `_generated/nodeRegisteredFunctions.ts`.
  - Every module under `convex/` is re-emitted to import from `_generated/registeredFunctions/{path}` instead of the previous aggregate file. Users who commit `convex/` to source control should expect a full rewrite of that directory on first codegen.

  ### Migration

  1. For each existing group, create a colocated `confect/{path}.spec.ts` and `confect/{path}.impl.ts` pair (under a subdirectory for nested groups).
     - In each spec, call `GroupSpec.make()` (or `GroupSpec.makeNode()`) without a name and `export default` the result.
     - In each impl, default-import the sibling spec (e.g. `import notes from "./notes.spec"`), pass it to `FunctionImpl.make`/`GroupImpl.make` in place of the previous dot-path string, append `GroupImpl.finalize` to the pipeline, and `export default` the resulting `GroupImpl` layer:
       ```ts
       export default GroupImpl.make(api, notes).pipe(
         Layer.provide(list),
         Layer.provide(insert),
         GroupImpl.finalize
       );
       ```
  2. Delete root `confect/spec.ts`, `confect/impl.ts`, `confect/nodeSpec.ts`, `confect/nodeImpl.ts`, and any parent aggregator spec/impl files. (`confect codegen` will also delete any of these it finds, plus the stale `_generated/registeredFunctions.ts` and `_generated/nodeRegisteredFunctions.ts`, so this step can be skipped.)
  3. Run `confect codegen`. Every module under `convex/` will be re-emitted.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [6db3a3a]
  - @confect/core@9.0.0-next.0
  - @confect/server@9.0.0-next.0

## 8.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 4bb2722: Bump Effect ecosystem to latest. `@effect/platform` is now `^0.96.1` and `@effect/platform-node` is now `^0.106.0` in `@confect/server`'s peer dependencies; `effect` peer is now `^3.21.2` across packages. Consumers must upgrade `@effect/platform`, `@effect/platform-node`, and `effect` in lockstep when bumping `@confect/server`.
- 40c1cff: Switch sibling `@confect/*` peer-dependency specifiers from `workspace:*` to `workspace:^`. Published peer ranges are now caret-based (e.g. `^7.0.0`) instead of exact-pinned, so non-major upgrades of one `@confect/*` package no longer fall out of range for its peer dependents.

  Paired with the Changesets `onlyUpdatePeerDependentsWhenOutOfRange` flag, this prevents the entire `@confect/*` family from being promoted to a major bump on every release when only minor/patch changes are present.

  `@confect/cli` additionally moves `@effect/platform` from `peerDependencies` to `dependencies`, since the CLI consumes it as an internal implementation detail (for `FileSystem`/`Path`) rather than exposing it in its public API. Consumers no longer need to install `@effect/platform` themselves to use the CLI.

### Patch Changes

- f308edd: Fix `confect codegen` and `confect dev` failing with "Cannot find package '@confect/core'"/"'@confect/server'" when the user's spec or impl files are bundled. The internal esbuild plugin used `import.meta.resolve(specifier, parent)` to resolve external imports, but Node silently ignores the second argument, so resolution always walked up from the CLI's own bundled file instead of from the user's project. Switched to `createRequire` keyed on the importing file's directory so external packages resolve out of the user's `node_modules`.

### Major Changes

- 60be7e6: Add Effect-native cron job support via new `CronJob` and `CronJobs` modules.

  Cron jobs are now defined using Effect's `Cron` (cron expressions) or `Duration` (fixed intervals) types instead of the vanilla Convex `cronJobs()` API. `CronJob.make` creates individual jobs with a unique identifier, schedule, and ref to an internal mutation or action. `CronJobs.make()` creates an empty collection with a chainable `.add()` method.

  Interval schedules are represented in the largest whole unit possible (hours > minutes > seconds) to avoid floating-point precision issues with large durations.

- 8ae4d51: Standardize all Effect service tags to a consistent `@confect/{package}/{ServiceName}` format.

  The `Storage` namespace export has been removed from `@confect/server`. `StorageReader`, `StorageWriter`, `StorageActionWriter`, and `BlobNotFoundError` are now exported as individual top-level namespaces. Replace `Storage.StorageReader` with `StorageReader.StorageReader`, etc. After upgrading, rerun `confect codegen` to regenerate the `services.ts` file.
